## About MarketplaceKit

MarketplaceKit is a platform for building different types of online marketplaces. MarketplaceKit attempts to reduce the development effort required to build product, rental, service and listing marketplaces such as Etsy, AirBnB, Handy and Zillow. It does this by attempting to cover the main components a marketplace needs, including the following:

- Powerful search across multiple fields, geolocation and custom fields
- Geolocalization for users and listings
- Frontend listing creation and browsing
- User profiles
- Direct messaging between users
- Multilingual functionality

MarketplaceKit uses popular, well documented packages without too much overhead to simplify a developers/designers life. Therefore, the following choices were made:

- Based on the popular Laravel Framework
- Leverages Bootstrap 4 for a responsive and mobile-first theme out of the box
- Separates theming logic from development by using Twig
- Avoids JS frameworks that require compilation
- Uses different widgets for different listing types (coming soon)

MarketplaceKit is easy to customize, change the design and supports multiple languages.
